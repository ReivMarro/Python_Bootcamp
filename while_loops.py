# similar to 'for loops' but more complex. It looks like this:
# while True:
    # print/do something
# This makes it loop through something until we tell it not to.
# For example:
num = 0

while num <= 8:
    print(num) # This needs to be managed/more instructions need be given
    num = num + 1 # This will keep printing the value 'num' and adding +1 till it reaches 10
    # Once the value becomes greater than 10 then the statement will become 'False' and the command will stop printing
